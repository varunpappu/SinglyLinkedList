Singly Linked Lists are a type of data structure. It is a type of list. 
In a singly linked list each node in the list stores the contents of the node and a pointer or 
reference to the next node in the list. It does not store any pointer or reference to the previous node.

The SinglyLinkedList consists of two files one containing the Node structure and the other file contatining the functionality.

The following are the functionalies added:
1)isEmpty() //Check if the Node is empty or not

2)insertFirst() //Insert elements in the beginning of the List

3)insertLast() //Insert elements at the end of the List

4)removeFirst() //Remove the first element

5)find() //Check if the element is present or not

6)delete() //Delete a particular Node, fails during duplication

7)deleteAllInstance() //Deletes all the instances of the value X

8)removeDuplicatesofNumber() //Deletes the duplicate of a particular number

9)removeDuplicates() //Removes all the duplicates of a number

10)sort() //Sort and then return of the Node

11)display() //Displays the Linked List
